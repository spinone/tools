**Clickjacking**
An example HTML page to provide a clickjacking proof of concept, which displays the target URL in 
an iframe and overlays a logon form over it to demonstrate how the credentials could be harvested.
The height and width of the overlay can be adjusted via the HTML code, and the login form 
can then be dragged into position to get decent screenshots.
